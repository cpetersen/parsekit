This is a sample text document for testing the parser-core-ruby gem.

It contains multiple lines and paragraphs to demonstrate
that the parser can handle various text formats.

The parser-core crate is designed to extract text from:
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Images with OCR support
- And many other document formats

This plain text file will be returned as-is since it doesn't need parsing.
