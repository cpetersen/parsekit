# Feature Comparison: Main Branch vs no-parser-core Branch

## What parser-core Crate Provides (Main Branch)

Based on the parser-core documentation, it provides:

1. **PDF Support with OCR**
   - Full PDF text extraction
   - OCR capabilities via Tesseract for image-based PDFs
   - Requires system dependencies (Tesseract, poppler, etc.)

2. **Microsoft Office Formats**
   - DOCX (Word documents) - via docx-rs
   - XLSX (Excel spreadsheets)
   - PPTX (PowerPoint presentations)

3. **Image OCR**
   - PNG, JPEG, WebP text extraction
   - Requires Tesseract system library

4. **Text Formats**
   - Plain text files
   - CSV files
   - JSON files

5. **Other Features**
   - Automatic format detection
   - Memory-efficient processing
   - Parallel processing (via rayon)

## What no-parser-core Branch Currently Has

### ✅ Fully Supported (Pure Rust)
- **Word documents (DOCX)** - via docx-rs (basic text extraction from paragraphs)
- **Excel files** (XLSX, XLS) - via calamine
- **JSON files** - via serde_json
- **XML/HTML files** - via quick-xml
- **Plain text files** - via encoding_rs with encoding detection
- **CSV files** (as text)

### ⚠️ Limited Support
- **PDF files** - Currently returns placeholder message. Could be improved with pure Rust libraries.

### ❌ Not Supported
- **OCR capabilities** - No text extraction from images or image-based PDFs
- **PowerPoint (PPTX)** - Not implemented
- **Image formats** (PNG, JPEG, WebP) - No OCR support

## Summary of Missing Features

### Critical Missing Features
1. **OCR** - The biggest gap. Main branch can extract text from:
   - Images (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
   - Image-based PDFs
   - Scanned documents

2. **PowerPoint (PPTX)** - Presentation format not supported

### Partially Missing
4. **PDF Text Extraction** - Currently stubbed out but could be implemented with pure Rust libraries like:
   - `pdf-extract` with proper configuration
   - `pdf-rs/pdf`
   - `lopdf`

## Possible Pure Rust Solutions

### For PDF Support
- **pdf-extract**: Already included but needs proper implementation
- **pdf-rs**: Modern pure Rust PDF library
- **lopdf**: Low-level but powerful PDF manipulation

### For DOCX Support ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **docx-rs**: Pure Rust DOCX parser - Now integrated and working!

### For OCR (No Pure Rust Solution)
- OCR fundamentally requires complex image processing and ML models
- No viable pure Rust alternative to Tesseract currently exists
- This will remain the main limitation of the no-parser-core approach

## Recommendation

The no-parser-core branch successfully handles most common document formats without system dependencies. The main gaps are:

1. **OCR** - Cannot be solved without system dependencies or a major Rust OCR project
2. **PowerPoint (PPTX)** - Could potentially be added similar to DOCX
3. **PDF** - Should implement proper PDF text extraction using existing pure Rust libraries

✅ **UPDATE**: DOCX support has been successfully added using docx-rs!

For most use cases that don't require OCR, the no-parser-core branch provides a cleaner, more portable solution.
