* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance

  * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### Ruby Styleguide

* Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
* Use RuboCop to check your code:
  ```bash
  bundle exec rubocop
  ```
* Write RSpec tests for new functionality
* Maintain test coverage above 90%

### Rust Styleguide

* Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/)
* Use rustfmt to format your code:
  ```bash
  cd ext/parsekit
  cargo fmt
  ```
* Use clippy to lint your code:
  ```bash
  cd ext/parsekit
  cargo clippy
  ```
* Write tests for new Rust functionality
* Document public APIs with rustdoc comments

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) for Ruby documentation
* Use rustdoc for Rust documentation
* Include examples in documentation
* Keep README.md up to date with new features

## Testing

### Ruby Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
bundle exec rake spec
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/parsekit_spec.rb
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rake spec
```

### Rust Tests

Run Rust tests:
```bash
bundle exec rake rust:test
```

Or directly:
```bash
cd ext/parsekit
cargo test
```

### Integration Tests

The gem includes integration tests that verify Ruby-Rust interaction:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/integration/
```

## Benchmarking

Run benchmarks:
```bash
bundle exec rake benchmark
```

Compare with pure Ruby implementation:
```bash
bundle exec ruby benchmark/comparison.rb
```

## Releasing

Releases are managed by maintainers. The process is:

1. Update version in `lib/parsekit/version.rb`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit changes: `git commit -am "Release version X.Y.Z"`
4. Create tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`
5. Push changes: `git push origin main --tags`
6. GitHub Actions will automatically build and publish to RubyGems
